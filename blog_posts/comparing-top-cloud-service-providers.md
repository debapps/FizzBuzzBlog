# Introduction

Cloud Computing is the buzzword in todays software development and service delivery arena. Most of the companies are migrating their services and data into cloud services to leverage the power of mordern cost-effective cloud infrastrutures. It offloads the overhead of on-premises data centers and IT operating cost significantly. There are also several IT companies provides cloud infrastructures and sevices in the market. Amazon, Google and Microsoft are the market leaders in this fields.

>Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) were the leading cloud service providers. While the cloud landscape is constantly evolving, This article will provide an in-depth comparison of these providers based on their common features and use cases up until that time. Keep in mind that there might have been updates or changes since then.

## Global Reach and Availability

   - **AWS:** AWS has the most extensive global infrastructure, with data centers in multiple regions across the world, allowing customers to deploy applications and services close to their end-users for low latency and enhanced performance.
   - **Azure:** Microsoft Azure also offers a robust global network of data centers, although it was slightly smaller in scale compared to AWS.
   - **Google Cloud:** Google Cloud Platform boasts an extensive network of data centers as well, offering a wide range of regions to choose from.

## Compute Services

   - **AWS:** Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides scalable virtual servers, enabling users to choose from various instance types based on their specific requirements.
   - **Azure:** Azure Virtual Machines offer similar capabilities, allowing users to run virtualized Windows or Linux servers.
   - **Google Cloud:** Google Compute Engine provides customizable VMs for running workloads, giving users control over CPU, RAM, and other resources.

## Storage Services

   - **AWS:** Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that allows users to store and retrieve large amounts of data. AWS also provides Elastic Block Store (EBS) for persistent block-level storage.
   - **Azure:** Azure Blob Storage offers object storage capabilities, while Azure Disk Storage provides persistent block storage.
   - **Google Cloud:** Google Cloud Storage provides object storage, and Persistent Disk offers block storage for VM instances.

## Database Services

   - **AWS:** Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) supports various database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server, making it easier to set up, operate, and scale relational databases.
   - **Azure:** Azure SQL Database offers fully-managed, scalable SQL database services, and Azure Cosmos DB provides a globally distributed NoSQL database.
   - **Google Cloud:** Google Cloud SQL supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server databases, and Cloud Firestore offers NoSQL document database capabilities.

## Networking

   - **AWS:** Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) enables users to create isolated virtual networks and connect them to on-premises infrastructure securely.
   - **Azure:** Azure Virtual Network provides similar functionality for creating private network environments.
   - **Google Cloud:** Google VPC offers virtual networking, and Google Cloud Interconnect facilitates connecting on-premises networks to Google Cloud.

## AI and Machine Learning Services

   - **AWS:** Amazon SageMaker offers a fully managed platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.
   - **Azure:** Azure Machine Learning provides tools and services for building, training, and deploying ML models at scale.
   - **Google Cloud:** Google Cloud AI Platform offers a range of ML services, including AutoML for creating custom models without extensive ML expertise.

## Big Data and Analytics

   - **AWS:** Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) enables easy deployment and scaling of big data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark.
   - **Azure:** Azure HDInsight provides managed big data clusters with various open-source frameworks.
   - **Google Cloud:** Google Cloud Dataproc offers managed Spark and Hadoop clusters for big data processing.

## Internet of Things (IoT)
